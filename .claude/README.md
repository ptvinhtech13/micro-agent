# Claude Conventions Folder

This folder contains conventions and context files that help Claude Code work more effectively with this project.

## Files

- `conventions.md` - Coding standards, architecture patterns, and workflow guidelines
- `project-context.md` - Project-specific context and important information
- `commands/` - Custom slash commands (create this folder to add commands)

## Usage

Claude Code automatically reads markdown files in this folder to understand your project's conventions and context. Update these files as your project evolves to maintain consistency.

## Adding Custom Commands

Create a `commands/` subfolder and add `.md` files that can be invoked as slash commands. See Claude Code documentation for details.
