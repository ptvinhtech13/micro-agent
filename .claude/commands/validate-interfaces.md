Validate the interfaces and implementations in the current code against the architecture in `/docs/architecture/high_level_java_design.md`.

Check:
1. **Interface Completeness**: Are all methods from the architecture defined?
2. **Method Signatures**: Do they match the design specs?
3. **Return Types**: Correct data models and types?
4. **Parameter Types**: Proper use of domain models?
5. **Missing Implementations**: Which methods are still placeholders?

For any issues found, provide:
- Specific line numbers
- Expected vs actual
- Suggested fixes
